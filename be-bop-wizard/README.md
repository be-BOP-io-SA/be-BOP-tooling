# be-bop-wizard

This is a self-guided installation and configuration tool for be-BOP.
It’s not a traditional “fire-and-pray” installer — it actually looks at your
system first, figures out what’s missing, and only does what’s needed. You can
think of it as a checklist manager for system setup.

## 💡 What It Does

- Inspects your system to see what’s already installed and running.
- Plans what steps are needed to bring the environment to a working BeBop setup.
- Prepares any missing tools (like curl, jq, or systemctl).
- Executes the setup tasks in the correct order.
- Summarizes what it did, what’s running, and where to look if something failed.

It can be safely rerun — it’s designed to resume where it left off without
breaking anything that already works.

## Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
be-bop-wizard.sh --domain example.com --email admin@example.com
```

### Command-line Options

See `be-bop-wizard.sh --help` for a list of available options.

### Examples

**Interactive installation:**
```bash
be-bop-wizard.sh --domain mybebop.com --email admin@mybebop.com
```

**Non-interactive installation (for automation):**
```bash
be-bop-wizard.sh \
  --domain mybebop.com \
  --email admin@mybebop.com \
  --non-interactive
```

**Localhost development setup:**
```bash
be-bop-wizard.sh --domain localhost --email dev@localhost
```

**Use releases from your custom fork:**
```bash
export BEBOP_GITHUB_REPO="your-username/be-BOP"
be-bop-wizard.sh --domain example.com --email admin@example.com
```

## System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

- **Debian 12** (bookworm)
- **Ubuntu 24.04** LTS (noble)
- **Ubuntu 22.04** LTS (jammy)
- **Ubuntu 20.04** LTS (focal)

### System Prerequisites

- User with sudo privileges (or root with `--allow-root`)
- Internet connectivity
- At least 1GB RAM (recommended 2GB)
- At least 10GB disk space

### Network Requirements

For production deployments (non-localhost):
- Domain name with A/AAAA records pointing to the server
- Ports 80 and 443 accessible from the internet (for Let's Encrypt)
- DNS resolution for both `example.com` and `s3.example.com`

## 🛠️ What It Installs and Configures

be-bop-wizard handles:

- Node.js and pnpm (for running be-BOP)
- MongoDB (database backend)
- MinIO (object storage service)
- Nginx (reverse proxy and HTTPS endpoint)
- Certbot (Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate provisioning)
- be-BOP itself — the latest stable release from GitHub

🔒 Security Notes

- Services are installed with strict systemd sandboxing (read-only system,
  private /tmp, no device access, etc.).
- Package repositories are added with GPG key verification.
- SSL certificates are provisioned via Let’s Encrypt automatically.

## Architecture

`be-bop-wizard` follows the **bootstrap-then-delegate** pattern:

```
be-bop-wizard (bootstrap)
    ├── Environment detection
    ├── Smart dependency analysis
    ├── System provisioning
    │   ├── Node.js + pnpm
    │   ├── MongoDB (with replica set)
    │   ├── nginx + SSL
    │   ├── phoenixd (Lightning Network)
    │   └── MinIO (Object Storage)
    ├── Application deployment
    └── Delegation to be-bop-cli (future)
```

### 🧩 How It Works (in plain English)

be-bop-wizard isn’t just a pile of shell commands. It behaves more like a mini
automation engine:

- It collects facts about your system — e.g., “MongoDB is running,” “Nginx is
  not installed.”
- From those facts, it decides what tasks to perform.
- Each task lists which tools it needs and what it changes.
- It executes those tasks in a controlled sequence, ensuring prerequisites are
  met.

Under the hood, it quietly borrows ideas from:

- Expert systems — rule-based reasoning (“if X is missing, do Y”)
- Effect systems — describing what operations can safely change the system
- Interpreters — reading a list of actions and executing them in order

Yes, it’s all written in Bash — a 1970s language running modern ideas.
A little bit of logic theory wrapped in duct tape and wizardry.

## Configuration Files

The wizard creates these configuration files using `ucf` for proper management:

### Repository Configuration
- `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list` - Node.js repository
- `/etc/apt/preferences.d/nodejs` - Node.js package preferences
- `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list` - MongoDB repository
- `/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg` - Node.js repository GPG key
- `/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg` - MongoDB repository GPG key

### Service Configuration
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/be-BOP.conf` - nginx reverse proxy configuration
- `/etc/minio/config.env` - MinIO credentials and settings
- `/etc/be-BOP/config.env` - be-BOP application environment

### Systemd Services
- `/etc/systemd/system/phoenixd.service` - phoenixd Lightning daemon
- `/etc/systemd/system/minio.service` - MinIO object storage
- `/etc/systemd/system/bebop.service` - be-BOP application server

### Security Hardening (VM/bare metal only)
- `/etc/systemd/system/phoenixd.service.d/overrides.conf`
- `/etc/systemd/system/minio.service.d/overrides.conf`
- `/etc/systemd/system/bebop.service.d/overrides.conf`

## Logging

Logs are written to:
- **stdout/stderr**: User-facing messages with progress indicators
- **journald**: System logging (if available)
- **Session ID**: Each run gets a unique identifier for correlation

View logs:
```bash
# View wizard logs
sudo journalctl -t be-bop-wizard

# View all be-BOP stack logs
sudo journalctl -t be-bop-wizard -t bebop -t phoenixd -t minio

# View specific service logs
sudo journalctl -u bebop -f
sudo journalctl -u phoenixd -f
sudo journalctl -u minio -f
```
